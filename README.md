## NEARHORE WAVE HEIGHT PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

### MOTIVATION
The motivation for this project comes from my passion for surfing. Living in Hawaii for about seven years, I really got into surfing. As surfers we are always looking for the next good time to go surf. As such we check the surf forecast from websites such as magicseaweed, surfline etc... These professinal surf forecasting websites use complicated and complex hydrodynamic numerical models which requires extensive and indepth domina knowledge for implementation. My goal for this project is to explore machine learning as an alternative to these complex hydrodynamic models, to predict near shore wave heights using offshore buoy wave data.
